A Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem

Originally written for a University Honours' Project toward my Bachelor of Computer Science. I'd published it on a personal website years ago, but let the domain lapse. Thought it was time to re-publish, even if the findings are no longer relevant. 

I only plan on publishing the paper portion, for now; the accompanying code needs work before it can bear public scrutiny.
